# How-to-write-a-README
This document provides a template and essential guidelines for creating a professional and helpful README.md file for your software project. A strong README serves as the project's documentation, offering a quick and comprehensive guide for new users and contributors.

The template contains instructions and boilerplate text that you may keep, modify, or replace entirely. **Any text shown in `{curly brackets}` is a placeholder and should be replaced with your own content.**

## {Project} logo and badges (Optional)
{Include an image of the project logo and add links to any relevant badges in the README.}

**Guidelines:**\
_{A project logo can help users quickly recognize and identify your project. Badges are useful for showcasing key information such as project status, health checks, or links to social media. Including relevant badges in your README can make your project look more polished and trustworthy.}_

## {Project Name}
{Include the project URL and project owner name underneath the project name if applicable.}

**Guidelines:**\
_{The project name should stand out in the README and be easy for users to recognize. It is typically displayed as an H1 heading at the top of the document.}_

## Table of Contents
{This section is optional depending on the contents/structure of your project}

**Guidelines:**\
_{A table of contents can be helpful for longer READMEs. As a project grows and more information is added, including a table of contents can make the README easier to navigate and better organized.}_

1. {Heading 1}
2. {Heading 2}
3. {Heading 3…}

## Project Description
{Write a clear explanation of what your project does and how it might help the user}

**Guidelines:**\
_{This is the most important part of your README. Focus first on the value and purpose of the project rather than the tools or technologies used to build it. You can then mention any limitations or situations where the project may not be the best fit for a user.}_

_{Include supporting visuals like screenshots or videos in this section to support user comprehension. All referenced assets must be present within the repository.}_

**Examples Sentence starters:**
* If you need to {verb} {noun}, {Project Name} offers…
* {Project Name} allows users to {verb} {noun}...
* With {Project Name}, users can quickly {verb} {noun}...

## Project dependencies

Here are some examples:
1. {Node.js}
2. {npm or yarn}
3. {MongoDB}
4. {Prerequisite 4...}


**Guidelines:**\
_{Include descriptions on why the prerequisites you list are required for your project to provide context and awareness for your users. Include relevant links to installation instructions or resources. Examples of project dependencies include: software and tools, environments, authentication, informative documents, or background knowledge.}_
